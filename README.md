## Assignment 1: Text Processing

This script takes a CSV file containing employee records as input and then parses the file for various employee related data points. The program also handles erroneous data by clarifying the incorrect data with the user and modifies data to follow a uniform format. After parsing the file into a series of objects representing individual employee data, the program then dumps the data in a pickle file, unpacks that pickle file and then displays the data in a user-friendly view on the command line.

You can view the [code here](./HW1/HW1_sxr180064.py) and the [writeup here](./HW1/HW1_sxr180064_overview.pdf).
