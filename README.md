## Overview of NLP

This is a list of statements which just answers some course questions regarding basics of NLP and what interests me about the topic.

The document can be [found here](./Overview%20of%20NLP/Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Assignment 1: Text Processing

This script takes a CSV file containing employee records as input and then parses the file for various employee related data points. The program also handles erroneous data by clarifying the incorrect data with the user and modifies data to follow a uniform format. After parsing the file into a series of objects representing individual employee data, the program then dumps the data in a pickle file, unpacks that pickle file and then displays the data in a user-friendly view on the command line.

## Assignment 2: Word Guessing Game

This script takes a text file and performs various text preprocessing procedures on it. After that, it gets the 50 most common nouns and proceeds to initialize a word guessing game using those nouns as the word bank.
